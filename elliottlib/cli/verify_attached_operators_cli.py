    """
    Verify attached operator bundle references are shipping or already shipped.

    NOTE: this will fail for obsolete releases prior to 4.6;
    that is when the bundle format was introduced.

    Args are a list of advisory IDs that may contain operator bundle builds
    and any container builds shipping alongside.

    Verifies whether the operator bundle references are expected to be fulfilled when shipped.
    An error is raised if any references are missing, or are not shipping to the expected repos,
    or if bundle CSV contents fail validation.

    By default, references may be fulfilled by containers that have shipped already or are
    shipping in any advisory (not just those specified). The omission options may be used to limit
    what is considered fulfillment; for example, to prepare an early operator release, specify both
    to ensure that only containers attached to the single advisory shipping are considered:

        elliott -g openshift-4.13 verify-attached-operators \\
                --omit-attached --omit-shipped 111422

    Since builds which are attached somewhere (should) include those which have shipped already,
    --omit-shipped has no real effect if --omit-attached is not also specified.
    If only --omit-attached is specified, then builds shipped previously are still considered to
    fulfill bundle references, as are those attached to advisories specified in the args.
