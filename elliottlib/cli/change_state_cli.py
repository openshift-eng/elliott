required to change an advisory to certain states.

An advisory may not move between some states until all criteria have
been met. For example, an advisory can not move from NEW_FILES to QE
unless Bugzilla Bugs or JIRA Issues have been attached.

    NOTE: The two advisory options are mutually exclusive and can not
    be used together.

See the find-bugs help for additional information on adding
Bugzilla Bugs.

    Move the latest 4.7 release advisories to QE:

    $ elliott -g openshift-4.7 change-state -s QE --default-advisories

    Move the advisory 123456 to QE:

    $ elliott change-state --state QE --advisory 123456

    Move the advisory 123456 back to NEW_FILES (short option flag):

    $ elliott change-state -s NEW_FILES -a 123456

    Do not actually change state, just check that the command could
    have ran (for example, when testing out pipelines)

    $ elliott change-state -s NEW_FILES -a 123456 --noop
