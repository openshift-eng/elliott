"""
This file contains the definition of a class that can be used like shell
pushd and popd.

The Dir object is a context_manager that can be used with the Python 'with'
clause.  The context manager idiom allows the user to execute some commands
in a working directory other than the CWD and return without needing to
explicitly handle it.

Example:

  # os.getcwd() returns /tmp/somewhere
  with Dir("/tmp/somewhere/else"):
      # os.getcwd() returns /tmp/somewhere/else
      ....

  # os.getcwd() returns /tmp/somewhere

    """
    Context manager to handle directory changes safely.

    On `__enter__`, `chdir`s to the given directory and on `__exit__`, `chdir`s
    back to restore the previous `cwd`.

    The current directory is also kept on thread-local storage and can be
    accessed (e.g. by multi-threaded programs that cannot rely on `chdir`) via
    the `getcwd` static method.

    The `assert_exec` and `gather_exec` member functions use the directory in
    effect automatically.
